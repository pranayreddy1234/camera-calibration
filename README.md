# camera-calibration
Camera calibration is the process of estimating intrinsic and/or extrinsic parameters. 
Intrinsic parameters deal with the camera's internal characteristics, such as, its focal length, skew, distortion, and image center. 
Extrinsic parameters describe its position and orientation in the world

#Design of Fundamental matrix.
The fundamental matrix is a relationship between any two images of the same scene that constrains where the projection of points from the scene can occur in both images.

# epipolar lines
The epipolar line is the straight line of intersection of the epipolar plane with the image plane. 
It is the image in one camera of a ray through the optical centre and image point in the other camera. All epipolar lines intersect at the epipole. 
Here the epipolar lines are drawn bwtween left image and right image.
